Genomic Peak Analysis Web Tool

Description:
The Genomic Peak Analysis Web Tool is a user-friendly platform designed for non-machine learning professionals to analyze ChIP-seq peaks and gain insights into DNA sequences associated with those peaks. This web tool provides a seamless experience for researchers working with genomic data, enabling them to perform XGBoost analysis and discover significant DNA sequences.

Features:
1. Genome Selection: Choose from a variety of reference genomes, including hg19, hg38, mm9, and more.
2. Positive Case Analysis: Upload a BED file containing ChIP-seq peaks as positive examples for analysis.
3. Negative Example Generation: Automatically generate negative examples by randomly selecting genomic regions based on the positive BED file, or allow users to provide their own negative BED file.
4. XGBoost Analysis: Perform XGBoost analysis to identify patterns and classify DNA sequences associated with the peaks.
5. Top Signature DNA Sequences: Display the top 10 signature DNA sequences learned by the XGBoost model, providing valuable insights into the underlying biology.
6. Optional Motif Analysis: Conduct motif analysis to identify enriched transcription factor binding motifs within the identified DNA sequences.

By providing an intuitive interface and leveraging machine learning techniques, the Genomic Peak Analysis Web Tool empowers researchers without extensive machine learning expertise to explore and uncover valuable information from their ChIP-seq peak data. The platform simplifies the analysis process, accelerates discoveries, and enhances the understanding of genomic regulatory elements.
